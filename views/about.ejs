        <p>I graduated from the Computer Programming program at Seneca College in Canada and 
            am working toward a career as a back-end developer. I have a strong foundation in 
            programming, logic, and web development, and I enjoy learning new technologies and 
            building side projects to grow my skills and solve real-world problems.</p>

            artificial intelligence, climate science, and space exploration.
